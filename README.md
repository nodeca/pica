pica - high quality image resize in browser
===========================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/pica.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/pica)
[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pica.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/pica)

> Resize images in browser without pixelation and reasonably fast.
> Autoselect the best of available technologies: webworkers,
> webassembly, createImageBitmap, pure JS.

[__demo__](http://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)


With pica you can:

- Reduce upload size for large images, saving upload time.
- Saves server resources on image processing.
- Generate thumbnails in browser.
- ...

Note. Old browsers may need `Promise` polyfill to work.
For example, [lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie).


Prior to use
------------

Here is a short list of problems you can face:

- Loading image:
  - Due to JS security restrictions, you can process images
    from the same domain or local files only. If you load images from
    remote domain use proper `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.
  - iOS has resource limits for canvas size & image size.
    Look [here](https://github.com/stomita/ios-imagefile-megapixel)
    for details and possible solutions.
  - If you plan to show images on screen after load, you should parse
    `exif` header to get proper orientation. Images can be rotated.
- Saving image:
  - Some ancient browsers do not support `canvas.toBlob()` method.
    Use `pica.toBlob()`, it includes required shim.
  - It's a good idea to keep `exif` data, to avoid rotation info loss.
    The most simple way is to cut original header and glue it to
    resized result. Look [here](https://github.com/nodeca/nodeca.users/blob/master/client/users/uploader/uploader.js)
    for examples.
- Quality
  - JS canvas does not support access to info about gamma correction.
    Bitmaps have 8 bits per channel. That causes some quality loss,
    because with gamma correction precision could be 12 bits per
    channel.
  - Precision loss will not be noticeable for ordinary images like
    kittens, selfies and so on. But we don't recommend this library
    for resizing professional quality images.


Install
-------

node.js (to develop, build via browserify and so on):

```sh
npm install pica
```

Transforms plugins for build via browserify:

```sh
npm install babelify babel-core babel-preset-es2015
```

bower:

```sh
bower install pica
```


__Attention!__. Compiled files are in `/dist` folder! If you wish to
load module in node.js style as `require('pica')` - your project MUST
be compiled with [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
to properly use Web Workers. In other case - use `require('pica/dist/pica')`.

**Webpack notice**

If you use Webpack to bundle your application, you probably need to define a [resolve
alias](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-alias) into your webpack config, like this:

```js
{
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      // Use compiled pica files from /dist folder
      pica: 'pica/dist/pica.js',
    },
  }
}
```

After that, you will be able to use pica as usual:

```js
import Pica from 'pica';
const pica = Pica();
pica.resize(img, canvas).then(...);
```

Use
---

```js
const pica = require('pica')();

// Resize from Canvas/Image to another Canvas
pica.resize(from, to, {
  unsharpAmount: 80,
  unsharpRadius: 0.6,
  unsharpThreshold: 2
})
.then(result => console.log('resize done!'));

// Resize & convert to blob
pica.resize(from, to)
  .then(result => pica.toBlob(result, 'image/jpeg', 0.90))
  .then(blob => console.log('resized to canvas & created blob!'));
```


API
---

### new Pica(config)

Create resizer instance with given config (optional):

- __tile__ - tile width/height. Images are processed by regions,
  to restrict peak memory use. Default 1024.
- __features__ - list of features to use. Default is
  `[ 'js', 'wasm', 'ww' ]`. Can be `[ 'js', 'wasm', 'cib', 'ww' ]`
  or `[ 'all' ]`. Note, resize via `createImageBitmap()` ('cib')
  disabled by default due problems with quality.
- __idle__ - cache timeout, ms. Webworkers create is not fast.
  This option allow reuse webworkers effectively. Default 2000.
- __concurrency__ - max webworkers pool size. Default is autodetected
  CPU count, but not more than 4.

__Important!__ Latest browsers may support resize via [createImageBitmap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/createImageBitmap).
You can try this feature by enabling `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-canvas-features`
in Chrome AND enabling `cib` in pica options:

```js
const pica = require('pica')({ features: [ 'js', 'wasm', 'ww', 'cib' ] });
```

But, as you can see in demo, result is still pixelated. So:

- `createImageBitmap()` is used for non-blocking image decode (when available)
- It's resize feature is blocked by default pica config. Enable it only on your
  own risk. Result with enabled `cib` will depend on your browser. Result
  without `cib` will be predictable and good.


### .resize(from, to, options) -> Promise

Resize image from one canvas (or image) to another. Sizes are
taken from source and destination objects.

- __from__ - source canvas or image.
- __to__ - destination canvas.
- __options__ - quality (number) or object:
  - __quality__ - 0..3. Default = `3` (lanczos, win=3).
  - __alpha__ - use alpha channel. Default = `false`.
  - __unsharpAmount__ - >=0, in percents. Default = `0` (off). Usually
    between 50 to 100 is good.
  - __unsharpRadius__ - 0.5..2.0. By default it's not set. Radius of Gaussian
    blur. If it is less than 0.5, Unsharp Mask is off. Big values are clamped
    to 2.0.
  - __unsharpThreshold__ - 0..255. Default = `0`. Threshold for
    applying unsharp mask.
  - __cancelToken__ - Promise instance. If defined, current
    operation will be terminated on rejection.

Result is Promise, resolved with `to` on success.

__(!)__ If you need to process multiple images, do it
sequentially to optimize CPU & memory use. Pica already knows
how to use multiple cores (if browser allows).


### .toBlob(canvas, mimeType [, quality]) -> Promise

Convenience method, similar to `canvas.toBlob()`, but with
promise interface & polyfill for old browsers.


### .resizeBuffer(options) -> Promise

Supplementary method, not recommended for direct use. Resize
Uint8Array with raw RGBA bitmap (don't confuse with
jpeg / png  / ... binaries). It does not use tiles & webworkers.
Left for special cases when you really need to process raw
binary data (for example, if you decode jpeg files "manually").

- __options:__
  - __src__ - Uint8Array with source data.
  - __width__ - src image width.
  - __height__ - src image height.
  - __toWidth__ - output width.
  - __toHeigh__ - output height.
  - __quality__ - 0..3. Default = `3` (lanczos, win=3).
  - __alpha__ - use alpha channel. Default = `false`.
  - __unsharpAmount__ - >=0, in percents. Default = `0` (off).
    Usually between 50 to 100 is good.
  - __unsharpRadius__ - 0.5..2.0. Radius of Gaussian blur.
    If it is less than 0.5, Unsharp Mask is off. Big values are
    clamped to 2.0.
  - __unsharpThreshold__ - 0..255. Default = `0`. Threshold
    for applying unsharp mask.
  - __dest__ - Optional. Output buffer to write data,
    if you don't wish `pica` to create new one.

Result is Promise, resolved with resized rgba buffer.


### What is "quality"

Pica has presets to adjust speed/quality ratio.
Simply use `quality` option param:

- 0 - Box filter, window 0.5px
- 1 - Hamming filter, window 1.0px
- 2 - Lanczos filter, window 2.0px
- 3 - Lanczos filter, window 3.0px

In real world you will never need to change default (max)
quality. All this variations were implemented to better
understand resize math :)


### Unsharp mask

Ifter scale down image can look a bit blured. It's good idea to sharpen it
a bit. Pica has built-in "unsharp mask" filter (off by default).
Set `unsharpAmount` to positive number to activate the filter.

Filter's parameters are similar to ones from Photoshop.
We recommend to start with `unsharpAmount = 80`,
`unsharpRadius = 0.6` and `unsharpThreshold = 2`.
There is [a correspondence between UnsharpMask parameters
in popular graphics software](https://github.com/nodeca/pica/wiki#editing-unsharp-mask-params-relations-in-pupular-softare).


Browser support
----------------

We didn't have time to test all possible combinations, but in general:

- Top level API should work in all browsers,
  supporting [canvas](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas)
  and [typed arrays](http://caniuse.com/#feat=typedarrays).
- [Webworkers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webworkers),
  [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/) and
  [createImageBitmap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/createImageBitmap)
  are not required, but they will be used if available.
- If you plan to use only pure math core,
  then [typed arrays support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=typedarrays) will be enough.

__Note.__ Though you can run this package on `node.js`, browsers
are the main target platform. On server side we recommend to use
[sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp).
